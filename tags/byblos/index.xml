Mäder will suggest the first two sound value proposals for the Byblos Syllabary ever achieved by external evidence. A cylinder seal published by Garbini in 2004, depicting the three daughters of Achenaton and Nofretete together with three names written in Byblos script attached to them, is compared to the Berlin Familienstele showing the exact same scene, with the names written in Egyptian Hieroglyphs.</description></item><item><title>James Hoch (1990) confirmed: The Byblos syllabary is indeed adopted from the Egyptian Consonant Alphabet</title><link>/news/2021-03-01-james-hoch-1990-confirmed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/2021-03-01-james-hoch-1990-confirmed/</guid><description>Back in 2017, Marwan Kilani pushed us to new realms by recommending Harvey Sobelman’s (1961) n-gram analysis and James Hoch’s (1990) suggestion of comparing the Byblos script to the Egyptian phonographic (consonantial) sub-alphabet.
