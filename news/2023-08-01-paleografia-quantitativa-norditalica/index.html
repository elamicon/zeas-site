Spoiler ante publicationis: Of the 24 Elder Futhark main types, 21 have identical shapes to graphic variants from North Italic Alphabets, with 13 of them also representing identical sound values, and a further 8 representing similar sound values (i.e. same place of articulation, but different kind of articulation = Phonetic Levenshtein distance of 1 (LDp = 1). Table 2 (from PQN, chapter 3.4) also delivers the combined Levenshtein Distance which cumulates graphical and phonetical similarity (LDg ∧ LDp). The combined Levenshtein Distance between elder Futhark runes and North Italic is so low that it would prove a direct genealogic descendance alone. But there is more to it: The so-called &ldquo;allpograph group borrowing&rdquo; phenomenon – e.g. the transfer of a group of variants with identical or similar phonetic values from one writing system to another, is a probabilistic prove for its own, at least if it inclueds cases with more than three variants involved. This is the case for the runes: If all existing variants with their (Germanic) readings are considered, several allograph groups have been transferred to Germania: The most extensive one is the k-rune  with its variants , , , , ,  and . All these graphemes represent velar sounds, and the group as a whole is a reflex of the North Italic velars  (Cam /k/),  (Cam /χ/),  (Ven /ks/),  (Cam /k/),  (Lep /k/; Lep /χ/),  (Lep /k/)  (Ven /g/),  and  (Cam /k/). Such a big allograph group makes it mathematically impossible for the sound/shape congruencies to be coincidental. In other words, the PQN table alone is the mathematical proof that the runes and are a subset of the Celtic alphabets.</p><figure><img src=PQN_Tab_Part1.png alt="First part of Tab. 1 in chapter 3.4.1 of the PQN."><figcaption><p>First part of Tab. 1 in chapter 3.4.1 of the PQN.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=PQN_Tab_Part2.png alt="Second part of Tab. 1 in chapter 3.4.1 of the PQN.

On a graph ical level, every single one of the 125 rune variants has its identical (76 of 125) or similar (49 of 125) predecessor in North Italic writing. Cumulated with the phonetic values, the combined Levenshtein Distance provides an impressive proximity. Reading example: Compared to their North Italic predecessors ///, the <strong>p</strong>-rune  has  a <em>similar</em> shape (LDg = 1) and an <em>identical</em> sound value (LDp = 0). Thus, its combined Levensthein Distance is 1 (LDg ∧ LDp = 1)</p><p>Moreover, the PQN shows that the overall Jaccard Index between elder futhark Runes and, for example, Lepontic, is higher than some of the Jaccard Indices among the North Italic Alphabets themselves! This forces us to consider the Germanic runes to be part of the North Italic alphabetic realm. Together with other arguments, we will present an overall rune origin theory at the ISRRI conference in Sankelmark, Germany.</p><figure><img src=Jaccard_Index_Calculation.png alt="Subset congruence ratio calculated by Jaccard Index.
