One more of these explanations – the <em>Rahmenquader Effect</em>, could be given solely due to the Reitia Alphabet Learning Procedure reappraised by actors of the &ldquo;Iluis Glanna&rdquo; Celtic Clan in 2021 Huttwil, Switzerland.</p><p>[This news article is an ultra-short excerpt of a GEAS article published in the proceedings of the 2022 ISRRI in Sankelmark, Germany:]</p><ul><li>Mäder, Michael (demnächst): „Der Fura-zara-kara-Merkspruch, der Rahmenquader-Effekt und ein alter Knoblauchkult: Die Übernahme des Futhark aus den norditalischen Alphabetritualen.“ Tagungsband ’Functions of Runic Literacy 200 to 1500 AD. Ninth International Symposium on Runes and Runic Inscriptions (ISRRI), Akademie Sankelmark, Germany, 14-19 June 2022’ (Runrön 26).</li></ul><hr><p>In the course of the theatrical procession of the 3rd century BC Reitia Learning Ritual, the &ldquo;prime disciple&rdquo; (i.e. the pupil who had to publicly learn the content of the learning tablets under the cheering support of the other pupils sitting around him) is confronted with a huge number of signs which look very similar to each other, and are at times identical. This is due to the fact that the frames of each case replace the hastae (long vertical strokes) as well as the bars (short horizontal strokes) of the signs written inside. As a result, only the codae (short inclined strokes) and the diagonal strokes are discernible as intentional parts of the sign. During the reenactment, this simple fact lead to virtually insurmountable problems for &ldquo;prime disciples&rdquo; who, in their real lifes, were not familiar with Venetic writing. Even when other pupils from the crowd, i.e. from the surrounding learning class, tried to help them out by handing over (modern) tables containing the Venetic signs, and even if the Ritual Master, Chantal &lsquo;Slania&rsquo; Bovard, showed herself patient and gave them time to find the phonetic value of the sign in qustion, it was often impossible to guess which sign was intended.</p><figure><img src=Abb_1_NEU.png alt="The six learning steps of the Venetic Alphabet ritual.

The only possible anwers were like &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is&rdquo;, or &ldquo;you have to accept&rdquo;. According to the notes taken during the reenactment by GEAS contributor E. van den Bold, sentences as the following were often-heard: &ldquo;You are right, it could also be sign x, but here sign y is intended&mldr; please repeat it loudly so you will remember it in the next run.&rdquo;</p><p>The unavoidable confoundments among existing signs are made even worse by the fact that several times during the learning procedure the tablet has to be turned around by 90 or 180 degrees. As a result, it is impossible for beginners to orientate themselves.</p><p>One other result of the Rahmenquader Effect is that if a pupil tries to remember sign shapes afterwards, he has troubles to recreate the intended forms as there are no indications as to whether a certain hasta or bar must be added or not to the visible part of the sign. This is what could be called the <em>productive part of the Rahmenquader Effect</em>. During the post-processing of the reenactment, Sara Amadori, Co-Author of the <a href=https://center-for-decipherment.ch/journal/>Paleografia Quantitative Norditalica</a>, brought up the question of whether it was an option for writers in antiquity to leave away or add certain strokes. Instead of answering with yes or no, M. Mäder, GEAS director and scientific leader of the reenactment, came up with the fact that from 3rd century BC onwards, certain signs were split into two allographs, i. e. a certain sound value could now be written by two similar graphemes in Lepontic writing (Maras 2014, Breve storia della scrittura celtica d’Italia. Ziχu 1:73–93). In the subsequent discussions, it becaume clear that some of the possible allographs produced by the Rahmenquader Effect happen to be runes.</p><h2 id=the-productivity-of-the-rahmenquader-effect>The productivity of the Rahmenquader Effect</h2><p>From c. 300 BC onwards, a large number of signs appear in North Italic writing, especially in Lepontic. They are characterized by inversion, and by added or eliminated strokes compared to their pre-300 BC predecessors. Crucially, most of the new shapes happened to become Germanic runes, too. The GEAS Rune Provenance Theory also points out a special writing style in late Lepontic (1st to 3rd century BC) Wallis, Switzerland, which they call sedunic / late lepontic fashion style. It is characterized by angular, close-to-45° angles and straight, clear strokes, and thus is to be considered proto-runic.</p><figure><img src=Table_3.png alt="New shapes produced by the Rahmenquader Effect"><figcaption><p>New shapes produced by the Rahmenquader Effect</p></figcaption></figure><p>New shapes produced by the Rahmenquader Effect</p><figure><img src=Abb_4_Celtic_Coins.png alt="A “Rahmenquader”-generated variant of the d-rune on the Frøyhov inscription (a).
