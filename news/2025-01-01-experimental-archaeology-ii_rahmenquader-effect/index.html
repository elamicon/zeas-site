One more of these explanations – the <em>Rahmenquader Effect</em>, could be given solely due to the Reitia Alphabet Learning Procedure reappraised by actors of the &ldquo;Iluis Glanna&rdquo; Celtic Clan in 2021 at Huttwil, Switzerland.</p><hr><p>This news article is an ultra-short excerpt of a GEAS article published in the proceedings of the 2022 ISRRI in Sankelmark, Germany:</p><ul><li>Mäder, Michael (demnächst): „Der Fura-zara-kara-Merkspruch, der Rahmenquader-Effekt und ein alter Knoblauchkult: Die Übernahme des Futhark aus den norditalischen Alphabetritualen.“ Tagungsband ’Functions of Runic Literacy 200 to 1500 AD. Ninth International Symposium on Runes and Runic Inscriptions (ISRRI), Akademie Sankelmark, Germany, 14-19 June 2022’ (Runrön 26).</li></ul><hr><p>In the course of the theatrical procession of the 3rd century BC Reitia Learning Ritual, the &ldquo;prime disciple&rdquo; (i.e. the pupil who had to exert under the cheering support of the other pupils sitting around him) is confronted with a huge number of signs that look very similar to each other, and are at times identical. This is due to the fact that the frames of each case replace the hastae (long vertical strokes) as well as the bars (short horizontal strokes) of the signs written inside. As a result, only the codae (short inclined strokes) and the diagonal strokes are discernible as intentional parts of the sign. During the reenactment, this simple fact lead to virtually insurmountable problems for &ldquo;prime disciples&rdquo; who, in their real lifes, were not familiar with Venetic writing. Even when other pupils from the crowd, i.e. from the surrounding learning class, tried to help them out by handing over (modern) tables containing the Venetic signs, and even if the Ritual Master, Chantal &lsquo;Slania&rsquo; Bovard, showed herself patient and gave them time to find the phonetic value of the sign in qustion, it was often impossible to guess how a certain sign had to be pronounced.</p><figure><img src=Tablet_E23.png alt="E23 ist the most complete one of the c. 29 bronze tablets found at the Reitia ritual place in Este. Even though the strokes are perfectly legible, the signs are often underspecified. For instance,  (or  if we include the frame) can stand for  /ϑ/ (Theta), but in other cases stands for  /t/ (Tau). For a transliteration, see Abb. 2 in the article cited above."><figcaption><p>E23 ist the most complete one of the c. 29 bronze tablets found at the Reitia ritual place in Este.

As a result, it was impossible for beginners to orientate themselves. If we assume that uneducated Germanic soldiers would take a copy of a tablet back home to Germania in order to write down the names of their beloved ones, it is obvious that they would make mistakes and confoundments in virtually every single grapheme. Thus, the Rahmenquader Effect delivers a reasonable explanation for the evidence found in Elder Futhark inscriptions: inconsistent use of the graphemes, plenty of mirrored and inverted signs, and a number of new signs which sometimes would even become main runes when canonized as such in the futhark inscriptions between 400 and 600 AD.</p><h2 id=the-productivity-of-the-rahmenquader-effect>The productivity of the Rahmenquader Effect</h2><p>From c. 300 BC onwards, a considerable number of new sign variants appear in North Italic writing, especially in Lepontic (cf. Maras 2014, Breve storia della scrittura celtica d’Italia. Ziχu 1:73–93). They are characterized by inversion, and by added or eliminated strokes compared to their pre-300 BC predecessors. Crucially, most of the new shapes happened to become Germanic runes, too. The GEAS Rune Provenance Theory also discusses a particular writing style in late Lepontic (1st century BC to 2nd century AD) represented by three inscriptions from Wallis, Switzerland, which they call sedunic / late lepontic fashion style. It is characterized by angular, close-to-45° angles and straight, clear strokes, and thus is to be considered proto-runic, i.e. intermediate between North Italic and Germanic wirting.</p><figure><img src=Table_3.png alt="New shapes produced by the Rahmenquader Effect"><figcaption><p>New shapes produced by the Rahmenquader Effect</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=Abb_4_Celtic_Coins.png alt="A Rahmenquader-generated variant of the d-rune on the Frøyhov inscription.
