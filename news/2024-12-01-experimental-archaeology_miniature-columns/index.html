At the other hand, archaeology has shown that North Italic writing was in use much longer than previously assumed, i.e. up to the 2nd century AD. With this, the Venetic &ldquo;Reitia alphabet rituals&rdquo; have once again come into focus as the source of Germanic writing. An article authored by GEAS members methods now claims to have solved virtually all of the rune provenance problemsb enabled by the use of experimental archaeology.</p><p>[This news article is an ultra-short excerpt of the GEAS Rune Provenance Theory, answer every single question as to how writing emerged in Germania, which again is published in the following papers:]</p><ul><li>Mäder, Michael (im Druck): „Der Fura-zara-kara-Merkspruch, der Rahmenquader-Effekt und ein alter Knoblauchkult: Die Übernahme des Futhark aus den norditalischen Alphabetritualen.“ Tagungsband ’Functions of Runic Literacy 200 to 1500 AD.

At night, after the doors would close for the public and the site would turn into a mystic scenery lid by torches and filled with the charmful singing of the neighbouring clans, the members of Iluis Glanna gathered around the bonfire and performed a ritual that has the potential to influence the real-world academic scholarship: The loudly sung and spoken reenactment of the &ldquo;Reitia&rdquo; alphabet ritual, documented on multiple 3rd century BC bronze tablets from Este, Northern Italy. According to the GEAS article published in the ISRRI proceedings,</p><p>I) the futhark order originates from the Fura-zara-(ϑera)-kara mnemonic written on the final lines of the learning tablets;
II) the inverse runes (&ldquo;Sturzrunen&rdquo;) emerge from the fact that the tablet had to be turned around by 180° several times during the ritual;
III) several new letter forms have emerged from the fact that the rectangular grid (&ldquo;Rahmenquader&rdquo;) confused uneducated users (e.g. Germanic Soldiers) as they allowed to the writer to omit vertical and horizontal strokes (e.g. runic  from Venetic ).</p><p>The explanation of the &ldquo;Sturzeffekt&rdquo; (B) and the &ldquo;Rahmenquader-Effekt&rdquo; (C) will be explained [[in other news sketches]]. In the following lines we focus on the genesis of the letter order (A):</p><p>According to the reconstruction by Pellegrini & Prosdocimi 1967 and Lejeune 1971, the bronze tablets had initially been used as a learning tool (4.–3. century BC) and have later been fossilized into pure ritual use for worshipping Reitia, the Venetic goddess of writing and knowledge. The ritual consists of several consecutive &ldquo;learning steps&rdquo; which can quite clearly be understood by modern scholars (see Abb. 1).</p><p>The sixth step, which was the last and most difficult one, urged the pupil to memorize those consonant clusters which are, in Venetic orthography, exceptions to a complicated rule called syllable punctuation. In its vocalized form, the order of these non-punctuated clusters is Fura-funa-fula-fu / Zara-zana-zala / ϑera-ϑena-ϑela Kara-kana-kala-ka &mldr;(see Abb. 2).</p><p>As can be seen in Abb. 2, the second element of the clusters is always -r, -n, -l, -ø, so for the learning process it was – and still is for modern learners of Venetic! – enough to memorize the first clusters of each group (i.e. the ones underlined in Abb. 2). At this point, some knowledge of Old European writing must be adduced: a) the bigraph  ⟨vh⟩ is spelled as an /f/ in Venetic. b) Because of the fact that  has retained its phoenician letter name /waw/, 
, when spelled as a letter name, was vocalized on -au or -u (while the letters ⟨r⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨k⟩ were vocalized on -a, and the Theta ⟨ϑ⟩ on -e), the result is the following mnemonic:</p><p>Fura-zara-ϑera-kara-&mldr;</p><p>As is generally known in North Italic linguistics, the Theta (ϑ) was a so-called &ldquo;lettre morte&rdquo; (Lejeune): It had been inherited from the Etruscan alphabet and was upheld as an element in theoretical alphabetaries, but was omitted in the practical use of writing because the corresponding dental sound was inexistant in the Venetic language. As a result, we obtain</p><p>Fura-zara-kara</p><p>which is a reasonable model for the Germanic alphabet name.</p><p>Accoding to the GEAS the striking inconsistency in the Germanic Alphabetaries after the first five to six letter names (see Tab. 1) can be explained by cross-linguistic restrictions of phonetic key-word memorization. Thus, the futhark order must have been transferred to the North by acoustic imitation, namely the imitation of the Fura-zara-kara mnemonic. This insight, together with ample evidence from the archaeology of the earliest rune inscriptions (see fn. 5 in the article), favourizes the so-called mercenary thesis: The transfer of the (defective) knowledge must have been</p><p>transacted by uneducated mercenaries who – maybe when working as a guard or rite assistant in Este - were confronted with the constant repetition of the Fura-zara-kara order during the learning rituals, and brought their defective knowledge back home to Northern Europe, alongside with inscriptions on their weaponry, or models for love letters (mostly female names, often accompanied with the germanic word leub &rsquo;love(ly)&rsquo; which they handed over to goldsmiths in their respective hometowns. (With this theory, the GEAS article responds to an insight recently pointed out by the runologists Sigmund Oehrl (2014), and Michelle Waldispühl (2013): Elder Futhark inscriptions on weapons are mostly executed in a professional manner, whereas inscriptions on jewelry and other gifts – ususally fibula, brooches, pieces of furniture or small statues dedicated to females – show unsophisticated scribing techniques and an inconsequent use of letters. This can only be explained by the mercenary thesis: Emerited Germanic soldiers had a professional scribe incise their weaponry in Northern Italy, and additionally prepared a wooden model of a dedicative inscription, usually a female&rsquo;s name or a word such as  φađa &lsquo;father&rsquo; found in the Frøyhov statue, in order to transfer that model inscription to the local Germanic artefact with their own untrained hands once they arrived at home.)</p><p>The article published in the ISRRI proceedings (Runrön) is an ultra-short version of the forthcoming monograph [[&ldquo;Die Runen und die norditalischen Alphabete: Eine quantitativ-paläografische Untersuchung im Lichte der Schriftentlehnungs-Typologie (mit einer umfassenden Runenherkunfts-Bibliografie von J. Schregenberger). Oppenheim: Nünnerich-Asmus Verlag.&rdquo;]] which discusses all the aspects of the GEAS Rune adaptation theory in detail. It includes the results from the Elder Futhark investigation which ist part of the PQN and shows that 76 of the 125 graphic variants of the runes (cf. PQN, chapter 4.1), as well as 21 of the 24 main types of runes, have an identical forerunner in the North Italic alphabet continuum, with xx of them having a similar phonetic value, and xx having an identical phonetic value (cf. PQN, chapter 3.4.1). Together with the Jaccard Index and combined Levenshtein Distance caluclations (LDgraphematic ∧ LDphonetic), the PQN (especially chapter 3.4 and Fig. 3) demonstrates the almost complete, and highly over-coincidental, graphico-phonological integration of Germanic runes into the realm of Old Euroean alphabets.</p><p>Some more content of the GEAS rune provenance theory, and why the theatrical reenactment of the ritual played a crucial and indispensable role</p><p>Besides the question of the futhark order, two more long-lasting misteries are claimed to be solved by the GEAS article: A) The existence of &ldquo;Sturzrunen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spiegelrunen&rdquo;, i.e. inversed and mirrored runes.</p><p><strong>The most telling figures from the GEAS publications:</strong></p><p><img src=Abb_1_NEU.png alt="The six learning steps of the Venetic Alphabet ritual.
