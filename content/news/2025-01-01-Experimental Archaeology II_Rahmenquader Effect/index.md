Besides the proposal for the development of the futhark order (cf. part I), the GEAS Rune Provenance Theory contains other micro-theses to explain unsolved problems within the Rune transfer question. One more of these explanations – the *Rahmenquader Effect*, could be given solely due to the Reitia Alphabet Learning Procedure reappraised by actors of the "Iluis Glanna" Celtic Clan in 2021 Huttwil, Switzerland.

[This news article is an ultra-short excerpt of a GEAS article published in the proceedings of the 2022 ISRRI in Sankelmark, Germany:]

In the course of the <font color="#9900FF"> theatrical procession </font> of the 3rd century BC Reitia Learning Ritual, the "prime disciple" (i.e. the pupil who had to exert under the cheering support of the other pupils sitting around him) is confronted with a huge number of signs that look very similar to each other, and are at times identical. This is due to the fact that the frames of each case replace the hastae (long vertical strokes) as well as the bars (short horizontal strokes) of the signs written inside. As a result, only the codae (short inclined strokes) and the diagonal strokes are discernible as intentional parts of the sign. During the reenactment, this simple fact lead to virtually insurmountable problems for "prime disciples" who, in their real lifes, were not familiar with Venetic writing. Even when other pupils from the crowd, i.e. from the surrounding learning class, tried to help them out by handing over (modern) tables containing the Venetic signs, and even if the Ritual Master, Chantal 'Slania' Bovard, showed herself patient and gave them time to find the phonetic value of the sign in qustion, it was often impossible to guess which sign was intended. 

{{< figure src="Abb_1_NEU.png" caption="The six learning steps of the Venetic Alphabet ritual. According to Lejeune (1971), the Fura-Funa-Fula-Fu row that lists all the consonant clusters that do not undergo syllable punctuation, was the last and the hardest to learn" >}}

Neither the Ritual Master, nor the scientific surveyor of the reenactment were able to deliver reasonable explanations to the pupils as to why a certain sign must have been intended. The only accurate anwers were like "That's how it is, we have to accept". According to the notes taken during the reenactment by GEAS contributors, sentences as the following were often-heard: "You are right, it could also be sign x, but here sign y is intended... please repeat it loudly so you will remember it in the next run." What made the confustion even worse was the fact that several times during the learning procedure the tablet has to be turned around by 90 or 180 degrees. As a result, it is impossible for beginners to orientate themselves. If we assume that uneducated Germanic soldiers would take a copy of a tablet back home to Germania in order to write down the names of their beloved ones, it is obvious that they would make mistakes in virtually every single grapheme. Thus, the Rahmenquader Effect delivers a reasonable explanation for the evidence found in Elder Futhark inscriptions: inconsistent use of the graphemes, plenty of mirrored and inverted signs, and a number of new signs which sometimes would even become main runes when canonized between 400 and 600 AD.


## The productivity of the Rahmenquader Effect

From c. 300 BC onwards, a large number of signs appear in North Italic writing, especially in Lepontic (Maras 2014, Breve storia della scrittura celtica d’Italia. Ziχu 1:73–93). They are characterized by inversion, and by added or eliminated strokes compared to their pre-300 BC predecessors. Crucially, most of the new shapes happened to become Germanic runes, too. The GEAS Rune Provenance Theory also points out a special writing style in late Lepontic (1st to 3rd century BC) Wallis, Switzerland, which they call sedunic / late lepontic fashion style. It is characterized by angular, close-to-45° angles and straight, clear strokes, and thus is to be considered proto-runic.
