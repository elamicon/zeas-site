Besides the proposal for the development of the futhark order (cf. part I), the GEAS Rune Provenance Theory contains other micro-theses to explain unsolved problems within the Rune transfer question. Two of these explanations – the *Rahmenquader Effect* and the *Sturz Effect*, are interlinked and could be given solely due to the 2021 reenactment of the Reitia Alphabet Ritual (see part I).

[This news article is an ultra-short excerpt of a GEAS article published in the proceedings of the 2022 ISRRI in Sankelmark, Germany:]

In the course of the theatrical procession of the 3rd century BC Reitia Learning Rituals, the "prime disciple" (i.e. the pupil who had to publicly learn the content of the learning tablets under the cheering support of the other pupils sitting around him) is confronted with a huge number of signs which look very similar to each other, and in parts identical. This is due to the fact that the frames of each case replace the hastae (long vertical strokes) as well as the bars (short horizontal strokes) of the respective sign. As a result, only the codae (short inclined strokes) and the diagonal strokes are discernible as intentional parts of the sign. During the reenactment, this simple fact lead to virtually insurmountable problems for "prime disciples" who, in their real lifes, were not familiar with Venetic writing. Even when other pupils from the crowd tried to help them out by handing over (modern) tables containin the Venetic signs, and even if the Ritual Master, Chantal 'Slania' Bovard, showed herself patient and gave them time to find the phonetic value of the sign in qustion, it was often impossible to guess which sign was intended. 

And neither the Ritual Master, nor the scientific surveyor of the reenactment was able to deliver a reasonable explanation as to why a certain sign must have been intended. The only possible anwers were like "That's how it is", or "you have to accept", or "you are right, it could also be
