## Tool Introduction
Check out our [decipherment tool](</tool/>)! Introduction to be done :-)


## Fonts

To use text snippets from the GEAS decipherment tool outside the sandbox, you need to install the fonts on your system. When the fonts are available on your system, you can choose them in all applications, and generate PDF documents containing the glyphs.

Downlad the [GEAS font collection](/tool/fonts/GEAS-Fonts.zip) and unzip it. Copy the TTF files to your system font directory.
